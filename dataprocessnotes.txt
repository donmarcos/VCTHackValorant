NOTES 

Data Processing of large data files 
using JQ and PowerShell (because yes I have a windozzee system)


this is particular to the Game Changers  data set  for Year  2024 ONLY 
does not mean this will apply to other years but for this process 
this is what I choose to do 


Step ONE 
process the VAL large data sets 
you can use a sampling by copying some of the VAL files on a different folder 
or process all of them , it does take some time so be aware of but
the end result is decent , we took 50gig worth of data and we flatten it out to 
300 megs 

- valfilter.ps1
- valfilterA.jq


the ps1 is our PowerShell script and the valfilterA.jq is our filter criteria on what we want to extract 
from the VAL data sets , it is pretty straight forward and it does not deal with very deep nested structure 
only what I think it is needed to process the VAL and events that I consider relevant for AWS BedRock
